# DigitalImageProcessingPython
In this repository i will upload some python scripts where i analyze images 

Most of the algorithms are based on Gonzalez & Woods (2018) "Digital Image Processing" 4th edition

You're free to use them and try your own images to see what happen

I would appreciate if you cite me in your works, in case you use the scripts
